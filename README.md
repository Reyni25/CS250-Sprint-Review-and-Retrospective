# CS250-Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

This Sprint Review and Retrospective provides an analysis of how the Scrum-Agile approach contributed to the success of the Travel project, a travel application development. It covers the roles played by team members, how user stories were handled, how interruptions were managed, and the communication strategies employed. The document also evaluates the effectiveness of Scrum tools and assesses whether Scrum-Agile was the most suitable methodology for this project.

## How I Interpret User Needs

To interpret user needs effectively, I focus on actively engaging with stakeholders to understand their requirements, pain points, and goals. This often involves:
- **Interviews & Feedback**: Talking with users directly or reviewing feedback to clarify what they need.
- **Defining User Stories**: Translating user requirements into clear, actionable user stories. Each user story answers the “what” and “why” of the feature.
  
Creating **user stories** helps because they break down complex user needs into manageable, clear pieces of functionality. The format typically follows:
- *As a [user], I want to [do something], so that I can [achieve a goal].*
This helps ensure the development is focused on delivering real value to the user.

## How I Approach Developing Programs

When developing programs, I follow a structured process that includes:
1. **Planning & Analysis**: Understand the problem, the users’ needs, and define clear objectives.
2. **Design**: Create wireframes or prototypes to visualize the user experience and validate design decisions.
3. **Incremental Development**: Build the project incrementally, breaking it into smaller, manageable modules or features.
4. **Testing**: Implement thorough testing (unit, integration, and user testing) to ensure each feature works as intended.
5. **Continuous Feedback**: Regularly incorporate feedback from users and stakeholders to refine the product.

I also incorporate Agile practices such as **Sprint Planning**, **Daily Standups**, and **Retrospectives** to keep the development process flexible, collaborative, and aligned with the project’s goals.

2. **Collaboration**: Work well with others, especially in cross-functional teams, and make sure the team is aligned with the project’s goals.
3. **Reliability**: Meet deadlines and take ownership of tasks while maintaining high-quality work.
4. **Flexibility**: Adapt to changes in requirements or approach when necessary, ensuring the project stays on track.
5. **Continuous Learning**: Stay updated on best practices, technologies, and new tools to contribute to the project effectively.
6. **Accountability**: Take responsibility for your work, own up to mistakes, and learn from them.
